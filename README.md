# CPOSC Presentation

Files pertaining to my CPOSC presentation, Lancaster PA, Dec. 1, 2018.

This repo contains a folder which holds:

* an R Markdown file, 
* a rendered HTML file that results from "knitting" that R Markdown File
* a CSV of Census Data
* a CSV of Philadelphia Child Lead Levels (in case the Philly Open Data site goes down)
* a supplementary handout .pdf
